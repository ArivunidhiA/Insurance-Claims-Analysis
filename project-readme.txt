# Insurance Claims Performance Analysis Project
================================================

## Project Overview
-------------------
This data science project analyzes insurance claims data to identify patterns, predict insurance charges, and provide business insights. The project uses real-world insurance data and implements machine learning techniques to achieve high prediction accuracy.

## Key Features & Achievements
------------------------------
* Analyzed 1300+ insurance records to identify key factors affecting insurance charges
* Achieved 85%+ prediction accuracy using Random Forest model
* Generated comprehensive visualizations for pattern analysis
* Created automated reporting system for business insights
* Identified key factors influencing insurance costs

## Technical Stack
------------------
* Python 3.8+
* Libraries:
  - pandas (2.0.0)
  - numpy (1.24.3)
  - scikit-learn (1.2.2)
  - seaborn (0.12.2)
  - matplotlib (3.7.1)

## Dataset Information
----------------------
The dataset contains insurance claim records with the following features:
* age: Age of primary beneficiary
* sex: Gender of insurance contractor 
* bmi: Body mass index
* children: Number of children covered by insurance
* smoker: Smoking status
* region: Beneficiary's residential area
* charges: Individual medical costs billed by health insurance

## Installation Instructions
---------------------------
1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/insurance-claims-analysis.git
   ```

2. Navigate to project directory:
   ```
   cd insurance-claims-analysis
   ```

3. Create a virtual environment (recommended):
   ```
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

4. Install required packages:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage Guide
--------------
1. Run the main analysis script:
   ```
   python insurance_analysis.py
   ```

2. The script will automatically:
   - Load the insurance dataset
   - Perform data preprocessing
   - Generate visualizations
   - Train the prediction model
   - Create analysis report

3. Check the output folder for:
   - insurance_analysis.png: Visual analysis
   - insurance_analysis_report.txt: Detailed insights

## Features Description
-----------------------
1. Data Analysis:
   * Basic statistical analysis
   * Correlation analysis
   * Pattern identification
   * Regional distribution analysis

2. Visualizations:
   * Distribution of insurance charges
   * Age vs Charges scatter plot
   * BMI vs Charges analysis
   * Regional charge comparison
   * Smoking status impact
   * Correlation heatmap

3. Machine Learning Model:
   * Random Forest Regressor
   * Feature importance analysis
   * Performance metrics (R² and RMSE)
   * Prediction capabilities

## Results & Insights
---------------------
* Model Performance:
  - R² Score: ~0.85 (85% accuracy)
  - RMSE: Typically under $4,000

* Key Findings:
  - Smoking status is the strongest predictor
  - Age has significant correlation with charges
  - Regional variations exist in insurance costs
  - BMI impacts insurance charges substantially
